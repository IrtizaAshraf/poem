        I pointed to a place where kids had made angels in the <br>
        For some reason, I told him that a troop of angels <br>
        had been shot and dissolved when they hit the ground. <br><br>
        
        He asked who had shot them and I said a farmer. <br><br>
        
        
        Then we were on the roof of the lake. <br> 
        The ice looked like a photograph of water. <br><br>
        
        Why he asked. Why did he shoot them. <br> <br>
        
        I didn't know where I was going with this. <br><br>
        
        They were on his property, I said. <br><br>
        
        
        When it's snowing, the outdoors seem like a room. <br><br>
        
        Today I traded hellos with my neighbor. <br><br>
        Our voices hung close in the new acoustics. <br>
        A room with the walls blasted to shreds and falling. <br>
        
        We returned to our shoveling, working side by side in silence. <br><br>
        
        
        But why were they on his property, he asked. <br><br>
