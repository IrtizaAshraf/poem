                At the bottom of my garden <br>
                There's a hedgehog and a frog<br>
                And a lot of creepy-crawlies<br>
                Living underneath a log,<br>
                There's a baby daddy long legs<br>
                And an easy-going snail<br>
                And a family of woodlice,<br>
                All are on my nature trail.<br><br>
                
                There are caterpillars waiting<br>
                For their time to come to fly,<br>
                There are worms turning the earth over<br>
                As ladybirds fly by,<br>
                Birds will visit, cats will visit<br>
                But they always chose their time<br>
                And I've even seen a fox visit<br>
                This wild garden of mine.<br><br>
                
                Squirrels come to nick my nuts<br>
                And busy bees come buzzing<br>
                And when the night time comes<br>
                Sometimes some dragonflies come humming,<br>
                My garden mice are very shy<br>
                And I've seen bats that growl<br>
                And in my garden I have seen<br>
                A very wise old owl.
                <br><br>
                My garden is a lively place<br>
                There's always something happening,<br>
                There's this constant search for food<br>
                And then there's all that flowering,<br>
                When you have a garden<br>
                You will never be alone<br>
                And I believe we all deserve<br>
                A garden of our own.<br>
